# wic-base
This repository contains fundamental data and documentation for the Waste Impact Calculator (WIC) framework. WIC estimates the life cycle environmental impacts (e.g. GHG emissions) associated with solid waste, and projects the impact consequences of solid waste management decisions (e.g. prevention vs. recycling).  WIC is [published in several repos, listed here](https://or-dept-environmental-quality.github.io/wic/).  

The files in this particular repo can be used to:

* understand the WIC framework and its assumptions
* see a few examples of the WIC framework in use
* construct your own applications of WIC, from simple to complex.

The authors are happy to take comments, positive or negative.  However, please read the [documentation folder](https://github.com/OR-Dept-Environmental-Quality/wic-base/tree/main/documentation) first!
