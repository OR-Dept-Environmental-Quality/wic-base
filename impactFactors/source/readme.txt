This folder contains impact factors exported by GaBi life cycle assessment software, which WIC code imports and modified to become the "finished" impact factors used by the WIC framework.

Most users will only be interested in the "finished" impact factors, available elsewhere in this file tree in the impactFactors/distributable folder.

However, if you are interested in the actual exports from GaBi, you can find them in the "current" folder.  If you find the source/current folder empty except for a zip file, you may need to extract the zip file into the same folder.  The reason for this inconvenience: GaBi's exports are too large to push directly to github, so the actual export filespecs have been placed in the .gitignore.  However, a compressed version of the files is small enough to be manageable.  

If you have a need to go back even farther than that, to the original GaBi modelling files, we'll have to work something special out because they are very large and awkward.  Please contact Martin.Brown@state.or.us or Peter.Canepa@state.or.us.  Thanks!
