This folder contains impact factors exported by GaBi life cycle assessment software, which WIC code imports and modifies to become the "finished" impact factors used by the WIC framework.

Most users will only be interested in the "finished" impact factors, available elsewhere in this file tree in the impactFactors/distributable folder.

However, if you are interested in the actual exports from GaBi, you can find them here in the "current" folder.  These exports are stored in a zip file because, while GaBi's uncompressed exports are too large to push directly to github, and therefore the actual export filespecs have been placed in .gitignore, a compressed version of the files is small enough to be manageable.  

The import process will attempt to extract the zip file for you, but if that fails, you may need to extract the zip file into the same folder on your local machine.

If you have a need to go back even farther than that, to the original GaBi modelling files, we'll have to work something special out because they are VERY large and awkward.  Please contact Martin.Brown@state.or.us or Peter.Canepa@state.or.us.  Thanks!
